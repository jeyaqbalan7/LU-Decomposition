# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1.Import numpy library using import statement
2. From scipy package import lu()
3. Get input from user and pass it as an array.
4. Get P, L, U matrix using lu()
5. Print L and U matrix

## Program:
(i) To find the L and U matrix
```
/*

(ii) To find the LU Decomposition of a matrix
```
/*

```

## Output:
![lu decomposition]()


## Result:
Thus the program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix is written and verified using python programming.
